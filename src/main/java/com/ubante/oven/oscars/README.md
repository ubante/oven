# Introduction

Imagine you are hosting an party for the Oscars.  You'd like a way for your guests
to predict on who they think will win the different categories.  There are some
paper forms you could print out.  But if you have a bunch of old phones and tables 
laying around, wouldn't you rather have an app?

This is the model for that app.
