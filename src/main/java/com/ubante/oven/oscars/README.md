# Introduction

Imagine you are hosting an party for the Oscars.  You'd like a way for your guests
to predict on who they think will win the different categories.  There are some
paper forms you could print out.  But if you have a bunch of old phones and tables 
laying around, wouldn't you rather have an app?

This is the model for that app.

# To do
  - Give the percentage of wins for movies with more than a single nomination
  - Tally up scores for people but that will require a Person and a PersonList class mebbe
  - do the thing with the Roids
  
# Alternatives

The analog approach is to use either [this link](http://oscar-prod-images.bls-customers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/04065826/23205726c534c1565bb3820a4ae1c5bef34fc16b39514bc7e046723395302466.pdf)
